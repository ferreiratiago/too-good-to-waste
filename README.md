# To Good, To Waste

## Introduction

Too Good, To Waste, is a solution to help everyone reduce food waste around the house before they go bad.

## Description

Too Good, To Waste offers an incredible opportunity for people to be self aware of their food deadlines (we know, "deadlines" is not the perfect word, but it sounds pretty awesome).

It starts by allowing any supermarket or convenience store to track their food using QR Codes instead of the usual barcodes and let costumers know about the next products about to expire to listing them on the receipt (BOOOOOM).

Once that's done, Too Good, To Waste web application will notify users on products about to expire really soon so they can start to think about what to cook with that precious delicious food. They can also manage what they have already eaten by using the web application.

The audience is everyone that loves food and gets annoyed when they go to waste. We dare to say that the audience is actually everyone. We're sure that even our grandmothers will love this idea and have it on their smartphones.

Because such an amazing project takes time and a lot of challenges we have used a bunch of technologies:

 * Node.js + Expresso
 * MongoDB
 * Socket.IO
 * AngularJS + Angular Material
 * Android SDK
 * QR Codes
